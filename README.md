This image describes the general flow, of the project and design of the project, where the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e12/data) was obtained from Kaggle. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted with the data, followed by preprocessing. Three machine learning classification models were used, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machines. The SVM model yielded the highest AUC score of 0.84. 

The three steps in the project can be visualized in the following notebooks with detailed documentation and explanation of code:
